Before we begin, (0.15s) from the Upanishads. (2s)

You are not a drop in the ocean. (1.5s)
You are the entire ocean in a drop. (6s)

Close your eyes… (0.8s) and settle into stillness. (4s)

This is an expansive awareness meditation. (2.5s)
We'll move from small to infinite. (5s)

Start by feeling your breath. (2s)
Just the breath. (3s)
Small. (1.5s)
Simple. (5s)

Now expand to feel your whole body. (2s)
Breath and body together. (6s)

Expand further. (1.5s)
Feel the space around your body. (2s)
The air… (1.5s) the room. (3s)
You're not just in the room. (1.5s)
You're aware of the room. (5s)

Expand again. (1.5s)
Imagine the building you're in. (2s)
All the rooms… (1.5s) all the walls… (1.5s)
Held in your awareness. (5s)

Keep expanding. (1.5s)
The neighborhood around you. (2s)
Streets… (1s) houses… (1s) trees. (3s)
All held in awareness. (5s)

Expand to the whole city. (2s)
Thousands of people, (1s)
All living their lives, (1s)
All held in your awareness. (6s)

Keep going. (1.5s)
The whole country. (3s)
The continent. (3s)
The entire planet, (1.5s) floating in space. (5s)

You contain it all in your awareness. (3s)
Infinite. (2s)
Boundless. (6s)

Now, (0.5s) gently come back. (1.5s)
From the infinite… (1.5s)
To the planet… (1.5s)
To the continent… (1.5s)
To the city… (1.5s)
To the building… (1.5s)
To the room… (1.5s)
To your body… (2s)
To your breath. (5s)

But notice… (1.5s)
That infinite awareness is still here. (3s)
It didn't go away. (2s)
It's always here. (6s)

You are both the drop and the ocean. (3s)
Small and infinite. (2s)
Contained and boundless. (6s)

Rest in this paradox. (12s)

You are vast. (3s)
You are everything. (8s)

When you're ready… (2.5s)
Feel yourself back in your small human body… (2s)
Carrying the infinite inside… (2s)
And open your eyes. (4s)
