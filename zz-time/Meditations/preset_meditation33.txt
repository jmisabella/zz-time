Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

What if the good things are already here. (1.2s)
Not waiting to arrive. (1s)
Not hiding somewhere else. (1s)
Just quietly present. (1.2s)
Waiting to be noticed. (5s)

Settle in… (0.8s) and close your eyes. (4s)

This meditation is about noticing what's already good. (2.5s)
Not the big things. (1.2s)
The small ones. (1.2s)
The ones we usually walk right past. (5s)

Let's start with breath. (2s)
You're breathing. (2s)
Without effort. (1.5s)
Without thinking about it. (2s)
Your body knows how. (3s)
That's remarkable. (4s)

Notice that. (2s)
Say thank you to your breath. (6s)

Now, (0.5s) the surface beneath you. (2s)
Holding you up. (1.5s)
Supporting your weight. (2s)
You don't have to float. (1.5s)
You don't have to hold yourself. (2s)
Something is holding you. (4s)

Thank you. (5s)

The roof over your head right now. (2s)
Shelter. (1.5s)
Protection from the elements. (2s)
A place to rest. (3s)

Thank you. (5s)

Your body. (2s)
Maybe it's not perfect. (1.5s)
Maybe it hurts sometimes. (1.5s)
But it's working. (1.5s)
Your heart beating. (1.5s)
Your lungs breathing. (1.5s)
Your mind thinking. (2s)

Thank you. (6s)

Someone who loves you. (2s)
Bring them to mind. (2s)
Maybe they're far away. (1.5s)
Maybe they're close. (1.5s)
But they exist. (1.5s)
Someone cares that you're alive. (4s)

Thank you. (6s)

A moment today that was okay. (2s)
Maybe just one. (1.5s)
A sip of water. (1.5s)
A glimpse of sky. (1.5s)
A moment of quiet. (2s)

Thank you. (6s)

Your senses. (2s)
That you can see color… (1.5s)
Or hear music… (1.5s)
Or taste food… (1.5s)
Or feel warmth. (3s)

Thank you. (6s)

This moment. (2s)
Right now. (1.5s)
You chose to pause. (1.5s)
To be still. (1.5s)
To come back to yourself. (3s)

Thank you. (7s)

Now just breathe. (2s)
And notice how gratitude feels. (3s)
A softening. (1.5s)
A lightness. (1.5s)
A warmth. (5s)

Not everything is good. (2s)
But some things are. (2s)
And that's enough for this moment. (8s)

Let's take three grateful breaths. (1.5s)
Breathing in what you have. (4s)
Breathing out what you don't need. (5s)

In… (4s) out… (5s)
In… (4s) out… (5s)
In… (4s) out… (6s)

Rest in this feeling. (10s)

Gratitude is always available. (2s)
Even in hard times. (1.5s)
Especially in hard times. (6s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Wiggle gently… (1.5s)
Maybe smile… (1.5s)
And open your eyes. (4s)

Look for one more small thing to be grateful for. (4s)
