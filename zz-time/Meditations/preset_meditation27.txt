Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

Your body is a vessel. (1.5s)
It carries your spirit, (1s)
Your mind, (0.5s)
Your stories. (1.5s)
But it's not all of who you are. (6s)

Close your eyes gently… (0.8s) and settle. (3.5s)

Imagine your body as a beautiful vessel. (2.5s)
Maybe a bowl, (1s) or a jar, (1s) or a cup. (3s)
Something that holds. (5s)

This vessel has been with you your whole life. (2s)
It's carried you through easy days… (1.5s)
And impossible ones. (3s)
It's weathered storms. (2s)
It's danced in sunshine. (5s)

Notice any cracks or chips in your vessel. (2.5s)
Maybe from pain… (1.5s)
Or illness… (1.5s)
Or just time. (4s)

Those cracks don't make it broken. (2s)
They make it real. (2s)
They're part of its story. (6s)

Your vessel doesn't have to be perfect to be beautiful. (3s)
It doesn't have to be perfect to be worthy. (6s)

Now imagine filling your vessel with light. (2.5s)
Gentle, (0.5s) warm light. (3s)
Pouring in slowly. (2s)
Filling from the bottom up. (6s)

The light fills your feet… (2s)
Your legs… (2s)
Your hips and belly… (2.5s)
Your chest and shoulders… (2.5s)
Your arms and hands… (2.5s)
Your neck and head. (4s)

The vessel is full. (2s)
Glowing. (3s)
Even through the cracks, (1s) light shines out. (6s)

Actually, (0.5s) especially through the cracks. (3s)
That's where your light escapes into the world. (6s)

Breathe as a filled vessel. (10s)

You are whole, (1.5s) even when you feel broken. (3s)
You are enough, (1.5s) exactly as you are. (8s)

Rest in this fullness. (14s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Feel yourself as both vessel and light… (2s)
Body and spirit together… (2s)
And open your eyes. (4s)
