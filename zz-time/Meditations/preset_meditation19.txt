Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

Treat every breath like a gift. (1.5s)
Not something owed to you, (1s)
But something received… (1.5s)
With gratitude. (6s)

Close your eyes… (1.5s) and breathe. (5s)

This practice uses the breath to release what you're holding. (3s)
We'll breathe in what we need… (1.5s)
And breathe out what we don't. (6s)

Take a deep breath in… (1s)
Breathing in calm. (4s)
And breathe out… (1s)
Releasing tension. (5s)

Again. (1s)
In… (1s) calm. (4s)
Out… (1s) tension. (5s)

In… (1s) peace. (4s)
Out… (1s) worry. (5s)

In… (1s) strength. (4s)
Out… (1s) doubt. (5s)

In… (1s) lightness. (4s)
Out… (1s) heaviness. (5s)

In… (1s) acceptance. (4s)
Out… (1s) resistance. (5s)

In… (1s) trust. (4s)
Out… (1s) fear. (6s)

Now breathe naturally. (3s)
Just notice each breath as it comes. (5s)

Each inhale is new. (3s)
It's never happened before… (2s)
And will never happen again. (4s)
This exact breath… (1.5s) this moment… (1.5s) unique. (8s)

Receive it with awareness. (6s)

And each exhale is a letting go. (3s)
Releasing the old… (2s)
Making space for the new. (6s)

In… (4.5s) receiving. (2s)
Out… (5s) releasing. (3s)
In… (4.5s) out… (6s)

This is the rhythm of life. (3s)
Receiving and releasing… (2s)
Over and over. (8s)

Breathe with gratitude. (14s)

Thank your breath for sustaining you. (3s)
For being with you… (2s)
Every moment of your life. (10s)

When you're ready… (2.5s)
Take one more conscious breath… (4s)
And gently open your eyes. (4s)

Keep breathing with awareness. (5s)
