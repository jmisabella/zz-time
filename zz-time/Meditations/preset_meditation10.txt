Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

You've survived every difficult moment in your life so far. (1.2s)
Every single one. (1.2s)
That's not luck. (0.8s)
That's strength you already have. (3s)

Close your eyes gently… (0.6s) and take a moment to arrive. (3s)

This meditation is about remembering your strength. (2s)

Think for a moment about a time you got through something difficult. (2.5s)
Maybe recently… (0.8s) maybe long ago. (3.5s)
You might not have felt strong at the time, (0.6s)
But you made it through. (5s)

You're here now. (1.5s)
That itself is proof of your resilience. (7s)

Let's breathe with that. (2.5s)
Inhale strength… (4.5s)
Exhale doubt. (5s)

Again. (0.5s)
In, (0.2s) gathering your power… (4s)
Out, (0.2s) releasing that which weakens you. (5s)

One more time. (0.6s)
In, (0.2s) strong and steady… (4s)
Out, (0.2s) letting go. (5.5s)

Now breathe normally. (3.5s)

Even when life feels overwhelming, (0.8s)
There's a part of you that remains unshaken. (2.5s)
A quiet core of strength. (4s)

Let's connect with that now. (2.5s)
Imagine a warm light at the center of your chest… (1.5s)
Your center of gravity. (1.2s)
Your anchor. (5s)

With each breath, (0.4s) that light grows a little brighter. (7s)

Breathing in… (0.8s) the light glows… (4s)
Breathing out… (0.8s) it expands. (5s)

This light is your resilience. (1.5s)
Your courage. (1.5s)
Your calm in the storm. (7s)

No matter what swirls around you, (0.8s)
This light remains. (8s)

Feel it now… (1.5s) steady… (1.5s) unshakable. (10s)

When worry or fear arise, (0.8s)
Come back to this light. (1.5s)
It's always here. (7s)

Breathe into it. (5s)
You are stronger than you think. (8s)

Let's take three powerful breaths together. (1.5s)
In through the nose, (0.4s) filling completely… (4s)
Out through the mouth, (0.4s) releasing fully… (5s)

Again. (0.4s)
In… (4.5s) out… (5.5s)

Last one. (0.5s)
In… (4.5s) out… (5.5s)

Rest in your strength. (12s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Roll your shoulders back… (1.5s)
Lift your chin, (0.8s) open your eyes, (1s)
And carry this strength into the world. (4s)

Or (0.85s) remain still, (1s)
The light glowing within, (1s)
As you surrender to sleep. (5s)
