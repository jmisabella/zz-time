Settle in… close your eyes.
Today let’s rest in the spaces—the tiny pauses that are always here.
Notice the brief stillness at the end of each out-breath… before the next in-breath begins.
That tiny gap… nothing to do… just space.
And the tiny pause at the end of the in-breath… before the exhale.
Rest there… in the space between breaths.
Whenever the mind wanders, gently escort it back to that quiet gap.
Nothing to achieve… nowhere to get to… just the gentle space between.
A few more breaths… resting in the pauses.
When you’re ready, let the breath flow normally again… wiggle fingers and toes… open your eyes—still carrying a little of that spaciousness.
