Comfortable… eyes closed.
Every breath is a new beginning. Every single one.
No matter what happened a moment ago—distraction, frustration, sleepiness—this next breath is fresh.
Inhale… a brand-new moment.
Exhale… letting the last one go completely.
Again… fresh start.
You can begin again as many times as you need. That’s the beauty of this practice.
If you drifted off for the last minute—or ten—that’s fine. The moment you notice, you’ve already begun again.
Soft smile… fresh breath… here you are.
Rest in this gentle cycle of beginning again and again.
When you’re ready… take a deeper breath… stretch… open your eyes—ready for whatever’s next.
