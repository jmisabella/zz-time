Before we begin, (0.15s) from Ralph Waldo Emerson's Self-Reliance (1.8s)

To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else (0.7s)
Is the greatest accomplishment. (6s)

Settle in… (1s) and close your eyes when ready. (4.5s)

This is a practice for releasing what doesn't belong to you. (5s)

Take a deep breath in… (4s)
And let it out with a sigh… (5s)

Again… (0.5s) in… (4s)
And out with sound… (5s)

One more time… (0.8s)
In… (4s)
Release… (7s)

Now breathe normally. (3s)

Think for a moment about expectations… (2s)
The ones you carry. (2s)
Maybe they're from others… (1.5s)
Maybe from yourself. (4s)

Notice them… (1.5s)
Without judgment… (1.5s)
Just acknowledge they're there. (6s)

Now imagine setting them down… (2s)
Like putting down heavy bags you've been carrying. (3s)
Just for now… (1s) you can set them aside. (8s)

You don't have to be anyone (0.8s) but yourself. (3s)
This moment requires nothing from you. (6s)

Breathe into that possibility. (10s)

Notice any lightness… (1.5s)
Or space… (1.5s)
Or relief. (6s)

If resistance comes up, (0.6s) that's okay too. (1.5s)
Just notice it. (3s)
You don't have to fix anything. (8s)

Let's ground back into the body. (2s)
Feel your seat on the chair or floor. (3s)
Feel gravity holding you. (3s)
You don't have to hold yourself up… (1.5s)
The earth does that. (8s)

Wiggle your toes slightly. (2s)
Feel your fingers. (2s)
Notice your belly rising and falling with breath. (8s)

This body… (1s) this moment… (1s) this breath… (1.5s)
This is enough. (10s)

You are enough. (16s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Take a fuller breath… (3s)
Stretch your arms if you'd like… (2s)
And gently open your eyes. (4s)

Welcome back. (5s)
