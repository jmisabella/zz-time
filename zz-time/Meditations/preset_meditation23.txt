Before we begin, (0.15s) from William Blake. (1.5s)

No bird soars too high (0.8s)
If he soars with his own wings. (6s)

Close your eyes… (0.8s) and breathe. (3.5s)

Imagine you're a mountain. (2s)
Ancient… (1.5s) solid… (1.5s) unshakable. (5s)

Your base is deep in the earth. (2s)
Your peak touches the sky. (3s)
You've stood here for thousands of years. (5s)

Weather passes over you. (2s)
Storms come… (1.5s) and go. (2s)
Sun shines… (1.5s) then clouds cover you. (2.5s)
Snow falls… (1.5s) then melts. (3s)

But you remain. (2s)
The mountain doesn't move. (6s)

Feel your body as this mountain. (2s)
Your seat is the base… (1.5s) rooted… (1.5s) grounded. (4s)
Your head is the peak… (1.5s) high… (1.5s) still. (5s)

Thoughts are like weather. (2s)
They pass across your surface, (1s)
But they don't change who you are. (5s)

Anxiety is a storm. (1.5s)
Let it rage across your slopes. (2s)
You remain steady beneath it. (6s)

Joy is sunshine. (1.5s)
Feel its warmth, (1s)
But know it will change too. (3s)
You remain steady beneath it. (6s)

Breathe as the mountain breathes. (2s)
Slow… (1.5s) ancient… (1.5s) patient. (10s)

Nothing can shake you. (2s)
Nothing needs to. (3s)
You are exactly where you need to be. (8s)

Rest in your mountain strength. (14s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Feel yourself as human again, (1.5s)
Mountain stillness within, (1.5s)
And open your eyes. (3s)

Or remain as the mountain, (1s)
Unmoving, (1s)
Letting sleep wash over you like weather. (5s)
