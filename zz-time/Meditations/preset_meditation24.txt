Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

Walking can be meditation too. (1.5s)
Not to get somewhere, (0.8s)
But to be fully present with each step. (6s)

Close your eyes… (0.8s) and get comfortable. (3.5s)

We're going to take an imagined walk together. (2s)
You don't have to move. (1.5s)
Just picture it in your mind. (4s)

Imagine you're standing at the start of a path. (2.5s)
Maybe it's in a forest… (1.5s) or by the ocean… (1.5s) or through a garden. (3s)
Whatever feels peaceful to you. (5s)

You take your first step. (2s)
Feel your foot lifting… (1.5s)
Moving forward… (1.5s)
Placing down. (3s)
Heel first, (0.5s) then toe. (4s)

Another step. (1.5s)
Lift… (1.5s) move… (1.5s) place. (3s)

Notice the rhythm. (2s)
Left… (1.5s) right… (1.5s) left… (1.5s) right. (5s)

You're not rushing. (1.5s)
Each step is intentional. (2.5s)
Each step is enough. (6s)

As you walk this path, (0.8s) notice what's around you. (2.5s)
Trees. (1.5s) Sky. (1.5s) Water. (2s)
Just walking… (1.5s) and noticing. (8s)

If your mind wanders to worries, (0.8s)
Bring it back to your feet. (1.5s)
Left… (1.5s) right. (2s)
Just the walking. (6s)

Keep walking in your mind. (2s)
Peaceful… (1.5s) steady… (1.5s) present. (12s)

This path has no destination. (2s)
You're not trying to get anywhere. (2s)
You're already here. (6s)

Continue walking for a few more steps. (10s)

And now, (0.5s) gently come to a stop. (2.5s)
Standing still on your path. (3s)
Feeling the ground beneath you. (5s)

Take a deep breath. (4s)
And another. (4s)

Know that you can take this walk anytime. (2.5s)
A walking meditation, (1s) even when you're sitting still. (6s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Come back to the room, (1s) open your eyes, (1s)
And continue your walk through the day. (3s)

Or (0.85s) let the path fade, (1s)
Footsteps stilling, (1s)
As you settle into sleep. (5s)
