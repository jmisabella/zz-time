Before we begin, (0.15s) from Hafiz. (1.5s)

Even after all this time, (1s)
The sun never says to the earth, (1s)
"You owe me." (1.5s)
Look what happens with a love like that. (1s)
It lights the whole sky. (6s)

Close your eyes… (0.8s) and breathe. (3.5s)

This is a meditation on self-compassion. (2.5s)
Being kind to yourself, (1s) especially when it's hard. (5s)

Think of someone you love deeply. (2s)
Notice how you feel toward them. (3s)

When they're struggling, (0.8s) you want to help. (1.5s)
When they make mistakes, (0.8s) you forgive them. (2s)
When they're in pain, (0.8s) your heart opens. (5s)

That's compassion. (6s)

Now, (0.5s) turn that same feeling toward yourself. (3s)

Place both hands on your heart. (3s)
Feel the warmth. (5s)

Say to yourself… (1.5s)
"May I be kind to myself." (4s)
"May I accept myself as I am." (4s)
"May I forgive myself." (4s)
"May I be patient with myself." (5s)

If it feels awkward, (0.8s) that's okay. (1.5s)
Just keep your hands on your heart. (2s)
And breathe. (6s)

You deserve the same compassion you give others. (3s)
You deserve to be gentle with yourself. (6s)

When you mess up… (1s) compassion. (3s)
When you're afraid… (1s) compassion. (3s)
When you're tired… (1s) compassion. (5s)

Breathe it in. (4s)
Feel it spreading through your chest. (3s)
Warm… (1.5s) soft… (1.5s) accepting. (6s)

You're doing your best. (2s)
And your best is enough. (8s)

Rest with your hands on your heart. (12s)

Let yourself receive this kindness. (3s)
From yourself. (2s)
For yourself. (10s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Take a full breath… (4s)
Lower your hands, (1s) open your eyes, (1s)
And carry this compassion forward. (3s)

Or keep your hands on your heart, (1.5s)
Compassion warming you, (1s)
As you float into dreams. (5s)
