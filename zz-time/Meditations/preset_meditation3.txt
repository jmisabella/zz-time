Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

The voice in your head that says you're not enough (0.8s)
Is just a thought, (0.4s) not a truth. (1s)
You can simply… (1s) let it pass by, (1s)
Like a cloud across the sky. (6s)

Settle into your space… (0.6s) and gently close your eyes. (3s)

Let's begin by placing one hand on your heart (1.2s)
And one hand on your belly. (4s)

Feel the warmth of your own hands… (1.5s)
This simple gesture of kindness toward yourself. (6s)

Now, (0.5s) take a deep breath in… (0.5s)
And as you breathe out, (0.5s) whisper softly to yourself… (1s)
"I am enough." (5s)

Again… (0.6s)
Breathe in… (3.5s)
And out… (1s) "I am enough." (5s)

One more time… (0.8s)
In… (3.5s)
Out… (1s) "I am enough." (8s)

Now let your hands rest wherever feels comfortable. (4s)

If worry arises, (0.5s) or fear, (0.5s) or doubt… (1.2s)
Don't fight it. (1.5s)
Just notice where you feel it in your body. (2s)
Maybe in your chest. (1.5s) Your throat. (1.5s) Your stomach. (4s)

Breathe into that place… (1.5s)
And imagine breathing out space around it… (1.5s)
Making room for it to exist… (1s) without needing to fix it. (7s)

Anxiety wants us to solve everything… (1.2s) to plan… (0.5s) to control. (2s)
But right now, (0.5s) just for this moment, (0.6s)
You can simply be with what is. (10s)

Let's take five slow breaths together. (1.5s)
I'll count… (0.8s) you just breathe. (1.5s)

One… (5s)
Two… (5s)
Three… (5s)
Four… (5s)
Five… (8s)

Notice the quiet that follows each breath. (6s)
That little gap between breathing out and breathing in. (3s)
Rest there for a moment. (12s)

Your worth doesn't depend on productivity… (1.2s)
Or perfection… (1s)
Or being anything other than what you are right now. (10s)

You are enough. (2s)
Just as you are. (14s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Gently wiggle your fingers… (1.5s)
Roll your shoulders… (1.5s)
And if you wish to return to the world, (0.8s) slowly open your eyes. (2s)
Or (0.85s) keep them closed and let sleep embrace you. (2s)

Carry that knowing with you. (5s)
