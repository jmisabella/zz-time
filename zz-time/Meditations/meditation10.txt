Wherever you are… let the eyes close for a moment.
There is only this one breath.
Not the next one… not the last one… just this one.
Feel it fully… the cool inhale… the pause… the warm exhale.
And now… only this one.
Nothing else is required of you right now.
If the mind races ahead or falls behind, that’s okay. Just notice… and return to this single breath.
This one… and now this one.
A few more… completely present for just this breath.
Whenever you feel ready… let the eyes open… carrying the simplicity of “just this” into whatever comes next.
Take whichever one calls to you today. Come back to them anytime. Wishing you many moments of calm and clarity.
