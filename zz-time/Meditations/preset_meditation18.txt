Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

You are not separate from nature. (1.2s)
You are made of the same elements as stars… (1.2s)
The same water as oceans… (1.2s)
The same carbon as ancient trees. (1.5s)
You belong here. (5s)

Settle in… (1.2s) and close your eyes. (4s)

Imagine for a moment that you're outside. (2.5s)
Standing barefoot on the earth. (3.5s)

Feel the ground beneath your feet. (1.5s)
Solid… (1.2s) supportive… (1.2s) steady. (4s)

The earth is holding you. (1.5s)
Just like it holds mountains… (1.5s)
And oceans… (1.5s)
And forests. (3.5s)

You belong here. (5s)

Now imagine a gentle breeze. (2.5s)
Feel it on your skin… (1.5s)
Your face… (1.5s)
Your arms. (3.5s)

The air is touching you. (1.5s)
Connecting you to everything around you. (5s)

Imagine sunlight warming you. (2.5s)
Feel that warmth sinking in… (1.5s)
Into your shoulders… (1.5s)
Your back… (1.5s)
Your chest. (4s)

The sun doesn't pick and choose. (1.2s)
It shines on everyone. (1.2s)
Including you. (5s)

You are part of nature. (2.5s)
Not separate from it. (1.5s)
Made of the same elements. (1.5s)
Earth… (1.2s) air… (1.2s) fire… (1.2s) water. (5s)

Breathe in… (1.2s) and imagine breathing in fresh air… (1.5s)
From trees… (1.2s) from the wind. (3.5s)

Breathe out… (1.2s) and imagine giving back… (1.5s)
Releasing what you no longer need. (5s)

In… (4.5s) receiving. (1.5s)
Out… (5s) giving. (2.5s)
In… (4.5s) out… (5.5s)

This exchange is always happening. (2.5s)
You're always connected. (7s)

Rest in that connection. (12s)

You belong to the earth. (2.5s)
And the earth belongs to you. (8s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Wiggle your toes… (1.5s)
Feel your actual connection to the ground beneath you… (1.5s)
And open your eyes. (4s)
