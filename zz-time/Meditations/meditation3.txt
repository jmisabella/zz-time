Get comfortable… and let the eyes close.
Bring to mind someone—or even a pet—who loves you exactly as you are. It could be a friend, a family member, a teacher… or simply the memory of being loved.
Picture their face… or just feel the warmth of that connection.
Now notice how kindness feels in your body when it’s directed toward you. Maybe a softness in the chest… a warmth… a lightness.
Let that feeling grow with each breath. Inhale kindness… exhale and let it spread.
Now gently place a hand on your heart and offer that same kindness to yourself. You might silently say:
“May I be safe… may I be peaceful… may I be kind to myself.”
No need to force the feeling—just the intention is enough.
If the mind says “I don’t deserve this,” that’s just an old thought passing by. Smile at it… and return to the hand on your heart… and the gentle words.
Breathe in kindness for yourself… breathe out kindness to anyone else who might need it today.
Rest in that soft, warm space for a few more breaths.
When you’re ready, let the hand slide down… take a deeper breath… softly open your eyes—carrying this kindness with you.
