Sit or lie down… close your eyes.
Notice whatever you might be holding onto right now—tension, worry, a plan, a feeling.
You don’t have to let it go all at once… just notice where you feel the grip in the body. Maybe tight jaw, shoulders, stomach…
Let’s breathe right into that place. Inhale… sending the breath there… exhale… imagining the grip loosens just a tiny bit.
Again… breathe in… breathe out… softening.
We spend so much time holding… it’s okay to experiment with releasing, even for these few minutes.
Each out-breath is a little letting-go. Like putting down heavy bags you’ve been carrying.
No need to drop everything forever—just for now… let the body be lighter.
If the mind starts planning how to pick the bags up again later, that’s fine. Just notice and return to this gentle releasing breath.
A few more moments of deliberate letting-go…
And whenever you’re ready… gently come back… feeling a little lighter, a little freer.
