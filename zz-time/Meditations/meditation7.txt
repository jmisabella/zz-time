Find a comfortable spot where you will not be disturbed…
Sit with back straight up, or lie down if you prefer…
Let the body get heavy… eyes closed.
There’s nothing to do now except soften.
Start with the face… let the tiny muscles around the eyes relax… forehead smooth… jaw loose… tongue soft in the mouth.
Neck and shoulders… let them sink into the surface beneath you.
Arms heavy… hands open and relaxed.
Chest rising and falling all by itself.
Belly soft.
Legs heavy… feet completely at rest.
Each time you exhale, feel one more degree of softening… melting… letting go.
If thoughts come, that’s okay—they’re just the mind winding down. No need to finish them. Let them drift off like smoke.
You’re safe… you’re held… everything can wait until tomorrow.
Breathe… soften… rest.
