Before we begin, (0.15s) from Lao Tzu's Tao Te Ching (1.3s)

Do you have the patience to wait (0.2s)
Till your mud settles (0.015s) and the water is clear. (5s)

Find your comfortable position… (0.8s) and close your eyes. (3.4s)

Imagine a jar of muddy water… (1.2s)
Shaken up… (0.5s) cloudy… (0.5s) unclear. (2s)

That's often how the mind feels… (0.7s)
Especially when anxious. (4s)

But watch what happens when you set the jar down… (1.2s)
And simply wait. (2s)

The mud begins to settle… (2s)
Slowly… (1.5s)
Naturally… (2s)
Without force. (6s)

We're going to practice that now. (3s)
Not forcing clarity… (1.2s)
Just allowing the settling. (6s)

Breathe naturally… (2s)
Nothing special. (5s)

Each time you exhale, (0.6s) imagine a bit more mud settling to the bottom. (3s)
The water becoming a little clearer. (8s)

Breathe in… (4.5s)
Breathe out… (1s) settling… (5s)
In… (4.5s)
Out… (1s) settling… (5s)

You don't have to do anything… (1.3s)
Just allow the natural settling. (10s)

Thoughts will swirl… (1.2s)
That's the mud in motion. (2s)
Don't try to stop them. (1.2s)
Just keep breathing… (1s)
And they'll settle on their own. (8s)

In… (5s)
Out… (1s) settling… (6s)

Feel your body getting heavier… (2s)
Like the mud sinking down… (2s)
Everything softening… (1.5s) relaxing. (8s)

Jaw loose… (2s)
Shoulders heavy… (2s)
Belly soft… (2.5s)
Legs melting into the surface beneath you. (6s)

Keep allowing the settling. (12s)

There's nowhere to rush to… (1.5s)
Nothing to figure out right now. (3s)
Just this… (0.2s) quiet… (0.2s) settling. (16s)

Notice the stillness. (8s)

This stillness is always here… (0.8s)
Underneath the noise. (10s)

When you're ready to return… (2s)
Take a deeper breath… (3s)
Wiggle gently… (1s)
And open your eyes… (1.5s)
Carrying some of that clarity with you. (5s)
