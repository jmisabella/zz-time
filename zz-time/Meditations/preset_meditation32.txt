Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

When you feel lost, (1s)
Your body is the map back. (1.5s)
You are always here. (1.5s)
You can always come home. (5s)

Close your eyes… (0.8s) and come home to your body. (4s)

When anxiety rises, (1s)
We often feel unsafe. (1.5s)
Like we need to escape our own skin. (3s)

But your body is not the enemy. (2s)
It's your home. (1.5s)
It's trying to protect you. (5s)

Let's practice coming back. (2s)
Making your body a safe place to be. (4s)

First, (0.5s) feel your feet. (2s)
Really feel them. (1.5s)
The pressure where they touch the ground. (2s)
The weight. (1.5s)
The temperature. (3s)
Wiggle your toes. (2s)
You have feet. (1.5s)
They're here. (4s)

Now your legs. (1.5s)
Feel the length of them. (2s)
The heaviness. (1.5s)
Your legs are holding you. (4s)

Your seat. (1.5s)
Pressing into the chair or floor. (2s)
Supported. (1.5s)
Held. (4s)

Your belly. (1.5s)
Place a hand there. (2s)
Feel it rise… (3s)
And fall… (3s)
Rise… (3s)
Fall… (4s)

Your chest. (1.5s)
Your heart beating. (2s)
This faithful rhythm. (2s)
It hasn't stopped since you were born. (3s)
It won't stop now. (5s)

Your shoulders. (1.5s)
Let them drop. (2s)
Heavy. (1.5s)
Released. (4s)

Your hands. (1.5s)
Open them. (2s)
Then gently close them. (2s)
You can move them. (1.5s)
You're in control of your hands. (4s)

Your face. (1.5s)
Soften your jaw. (2s)
Relax your eyes behind your eyelids. (2s)
Smooth your forehead. (3s)
Your face is safe. (4s)

Now, (0.5s) all of you at once. (2s)
One complete body. (2s)
Breathing. (1.5s)
Present. (1.5s)
Safe. (5s)

Say to yourself… (1.5s)
"I am here." (4s)
"I am safe in this moment." (5s)
"My body is my home." (6s)

Feel your body from the inside. (2s)
Not how it looks. (1s)
How it feels. (2s)
Alive. (1.5s)
Warm. (1.5s)
Real. (5s)

When panic comes, (1s)
You can return here. (2s)
Feet… (1.5s) legs… (1.5s) belly… (1.5s) chest… (1.5s)
Hands… (1.5s) face. (3s)
Home. (5s)

Take three grounding breaths. (1.5s)
In through the nose… (4s)
Out through the mouth. (5s)
In… (4s) out… (5s)
In… (4s) out… (6s)

Your body is not the danger. (2s)
Your body is the refuge. (7s)

Rest here. (12s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Press your feet into the ground, (1.5s)
Feel your presence, (1s)
Open your eyes. (1.5s)
You are home. (3s)

Or (0.85s) stay home in your body, (1s)
Safe and grounded, (1s)
Sinking peacefully into rest. (5s)
