Before we begin, (0.15s) a thought from Marcus Aurelius, (0.5s) Meditations (1.7s)

You have power over your mind, (0.8s) not outside events. (1.3s)
Realize this, (0.7s) and you will find strength. (5s)

Settle in… (1s) and softly close your eyes. (3s)

Imagine your mind is like the sky… (2s) vast… (1s) open… (1s) endless. (6s)

Thoughts… (0.5s) feelings… (0.5s) sounds… (1s) they're like clouds or weather moving through that sky. (2s)
Some light… (0.5s) some heavy… (0.5s) some stormy… (1s)
But none of them are the sky itself. (6s)

You are the sky… (1s) always untouched… (1s) always here. (7s)

Let's anchor ourselves in the breath for a moment. (3s)
Feel the cool air coming in… (2s) and the gentle warmth going out. (7s)

Whenever a thought appears, (0.5s) you don't have to push it away. (1.5s)
Just notice… (1s) "Ah, (0.5s) there's thinking"… (1.5s)
And watch it drift… (1s) dissolve… (1s) or change… (1s) like clouds do. (6s)

No need to clear the sky… (1.5s) just notice what's passing through. (7s)

And if you get caught up… (1s) that's okay too. (2s)
The moment you realize you're caught, (0.5s) you're already free again. (2s)
Softly return to the feeling of breathing. (9s)

Rest here as the sky… (1.5s) spacious… (1s) allowing everything… (1s) holding nothing. (12s)

A few more quiet breaths… (1.5s) just being the sky. (15s)

When you're ready, (1s) wiggle the fingers… (1s) stretch gently… (1.5s)
And open your eyes if there's more to your day… (1s) still spacious, (0.5s) still here. (2s)
Or simply remain here, (0.8s) eyes closed, (0.8s) drifting into sleep. (4s)
