Comfortable position… eyes softly closed.
Let’s start with something simple you can feel right now—maybe the support of the chair or bed beneath you… the clothes against your skin… the air touching your face.
Take a slow breath and silently say “thank you” for that support.
Now notice the breath itself—free, automatic, keeping you alive in this moment. Another gentle “thank you.”
Move the attention to your hands… these incredible tools… able to touch, hold, create. Thank you.
To your heart… quietly beating without ever being asked. Thank you.
You don’t have to feel overflowing gratitude—just noticing what’s already here, already working on your behalf.
Let each thank-you land like a soft pebble dropped into still water… watch the ripples of warmth spread.
Rest in that quiet appreciation for a few more breaths.
When you’re ready… stretch… open your eyes… still carrying that gentle gratitude.
