Settle in… eyes closed.
Imagine sitting by a gentle river. The surface might be rippling with thoughts, emotions, sounds… but deeper down, there’s a steady, quiet current.
That deeper current is always there… calm… moving… undisturbed.
Let the breath be an anchor to that deeper river. Each inhale… feeling the steady flow… each exhale… sinking a little closer to it.
When the surface gets busy—thoughts rushing by—just notice, “Ah, surface,” and softly drop beneath it again… to the quiet flow.
You don’t have to stop the ripples… just rest in the deeper current that’s always peaceful.
Stay here for a while… breathing with the river beneath.
When it feels complete, slowly return to the room… bringing a little of that quiet current with you.
