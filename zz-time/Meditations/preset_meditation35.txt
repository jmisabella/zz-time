Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

Between every in-breath and out-breath… (1.2s)
Between every thought and the next… (1.2s)
Between every sound… (1s)
There is silence. (1.5s)
And in that silence, (0.8s) you are free. (5s)

Close your eyes… (0.8s) and arrive in stillness. (4s)

This is an awareness practice. (2s)
Subtle. (1.5s)
Quiet. (1.5s)
Powerful. (4s)

We're going to notice the gaps. (2s)
The pauses. (1.5s)
The spaces between. (5s)

First, (0.5s) notice your breath. (3s)

There's the in-breath… (4s)
Then a gap… (2s)
Then the out-breath… (4s)
Then another gap. (3s)

The breath is always changing. (2s)
But the gaps. (1.5s)
They're still. (6s)

Rest your attention in those gaps. (3s)
In… (4s) pause… (2s)
Out… (4s) pause… (3s)
In… (4s) pause… (2s)
Out… (4s) pause… (4s)

Now notice your thoughts. (3s)
One thought arises. (2s)
Then space. (2s)
Then another thought. (2s)
Then space again. (5s)

The thoughts are loud. (2s)
But the space between them. (2s)
That's where peace lives. (6s)

Don't try to stop thinking. (2s)
Just notice the gap after each thought. (3s)
The moment before the next one comes. (5s)

Thought… (3s) gap… (3s)
Thought… (3s) gap… (4s)

That gap is you. (2s)
The real you. (2s)
Not the thoughts. (1.5s)
The awareness watching the thoughts. (6s)

Rest there. (10s)

Even sounds have gaps. (2s)
Listen. (3s)
Sound… (3s) silence… (3s)
Sound… (3s) silence… (4s)

The silence between sounds. (2s)
That's not empty. (1.5s)
That's presence. (6s)

Everything arises from silence. (2s)
Everything returns to silence. (5s)

You are that silence. (7s)

Just sit. (2s)
Just be. (2s)
Just notice the spaces. (12s)

Between breaths. (4s)
Between thoughts. (4s)
Between sounds. (5s)

In those gaps, (1s)
There's no anxiety. (2s)
No past. (1.5s)
No future. (1.5s)
Just now. (8s)

Pure presence. (10s)

Let everything else fade. (2s)
The thoughts can come and go. (2s)
You stay in the space. (7s)

Vast. (2s)
Still. (2s)
Infinite. (8s)

This space is always here. (2s)
You can return to it anytime. (3s)
Between one breath and the next. (6s)

Rest here as long as you like. (14s)

When you're ready to return… (2.5s)
Notice one more gap… (3s)
One more moment of silence… (3s)
Then gently, (1s) slowly, (1s)
Open your eyes. (3s)
The gap remains, (1s) always. (3s)

Or rest in the silence between, (1.5s)
In the infinite gap, (1.5s)
Letting it become the space of sleep. (5s)
