Before we begin, (0.15s) from the Bhagavad Gita. (3s)

When meditation is mastered, (0.8s)
The mind is unwavering like the flame of a lamp (0.6s)
In a windless place. (5s)

Find your comfortable position… (1.2s) and close your eyes. (4s)

Today we'll practice 4-7-8 breathing. (1.5s)
This technique is designed to calm the nervous system. (4s)

Here's how it works. (1.5s)
Breathe in for a count of four, (0.8s)
Hold for seven, (0.8s)
And exhale for eight. (3.5s)

The long exhale tells your body it's safe to relax. (5s)

Let's begin. (1.2s)
Breathe in through your nose for four… (0.3s)
One (1s)
Two (1.1s)
Three (1.1s)
Four (2s)

Now hold that breath for seven… (0.3s)
Two (0.9s)
Three (0.9s)
Four (0.9s)
Five (0.9s)
Six (0.9s)
Seven (2.5s)

And exhale slowly for eight… (0.3s)
Two (0.9s)
Three (0.9s)
Four (0.9s)
Five (0.9s)
Six (0.9s)
Seven (0.9s)
Eight (3s)

Good. (0.4s) Let's do that again. (0.8s)
In for four… (1.3s)
Three (1.1s)
Four (2s)

Hold for seven… (1.3s)
Three (0.9s)
Four (0.9s)
Five (0.9s)
Six (0.9s)
Seven (2.5s)

Out for eight… (1.3s)
Three (0.9s)
Four (0.9s)
Five (0.9s)
Six (0.9s)
Seven (0.9s)
Eight (3s)

One more round. (0.8s)
In… (1.3s) three… (1.1s) four… (2s)
Hold… (1.3s) three… (0.9s) four… (0.9s) five… (0.9s) six… (0.9s) seven… (2.5s)
Out… (1.3s) three… (0.9s) four… (0.9s) five… (0.9s) six… (0.9s) seven… (0.9s) eight… (5s)

Now let your breath return to normal. (3.5s)
Notice how your body feels. (1.5s)
Perhaps a little softer… (1.2s)
A little calmer. (7s)

This technique is always available to you… (1.2s)
Anytime you need to settle the mind. (8s)

Rest here in the calm. (14s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Take a natural breath… (1.5s)
Wiggle gently… (1.5s)
And open your eyes, (1s) returning refreshed. (3s)

Or stay in this calm, (1s)
Breathing naturally, (1s)
Letting sleep embrace you. (5s)
