Before we begin, (0.15s) from ancient Buddhist wisdom. (2s)

Peace comes from within. (1.5s)
Do not seek it without. (6s)

Close your eyes… (0.8s) and settle into stillness. (4s)

This is a grounding meditation using 5-4-3-2-1. (2s)
It brings you fully into the present moment. (4s)

Start by noticing five things you can feel right now. (2s)
Your back against the surface… (1.5s)
Your hands resting… (1.5s)
The air on your skin… (1.5s)
Your feet touching the floor… (1.5s)
The weight of your body. (4s)

Now four things you can hear. (2s)
Listen without judging. (8s)

Three things you notice about your breath. (2s)
Notice if it's fast or slow. (1.5s)
Deep or shallow. (1.5s)
Notice where you feel it most. (5s)

Two things you're grateful for in this moment. (2s)
They can be simple. (1.5s)
Just notice what arises. (7s)

And one thing that's true right now. (2s)
Maybe "I am here." (1.5s)
Or "I am breathing." (1.5s)
Or "I am safe in this moment." (6s)

Let's do this again, (0.5s) a bit faster. (1.5s)
Five feelings. (6s)
Four sounds. (6s)
Three breath qualities. (6s)
Two gratitudes. (6s)
One truth. (8s)

Notice how you feel now. (3s)
More grounded. (2s)
More present. (6s)

This practice pulls you out of worry (0.8s) and into now. (2s)
You can use it anytime anxiety tries to take over. (8s)

Rest here in the present. (14s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Wiggle gently… (1.5s)
And open your eyes. (4s)
