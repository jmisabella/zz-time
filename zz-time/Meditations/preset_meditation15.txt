Before we begin, (0.15s) from the Tao Te Ching. (3s)

Do you have the patience to wait (0.7s)
Until your mud settles and the water is clear. (1.2s)
Remain unmoving (0.7s)
Until the right action arises by itself. (5s)

Let your eyes close… (1.2s) and be still. (4s)

This is a counting meditation. (1.5s)
Simple, (0.4s) but powerful. (4s)

We'll count breaths from one to ten… (1.2s)
Then start over. (2.5s)
When your mind wanders, (0.5s)
And it will, (0.8s)
Simply return to one. (5s)

Let's begin. (1.5s)
Breathe in… (4s)
Breathe out… (0.8s) one. (4s)

In… (4s)
Out… (0.8s) two. (4s)

In… (4s)
Out… (0.8s) three. (4s)

In… (4s)
Out… (0.8s) four. (4s)

In… (4s)
Out… (0.8s) five. (4s)

In… (4s)
Out… (0.8s) six. (4s)

In… (4s)
Out… (0.8s) seven. (4s)

In… (4s)
Out… (0.8s) eight. (4s)

In… (4s)
Out… (0.8s) nine. (4s)

In… (4s)
Out… (0.8s) ten. (5.5s)

Good. (0.8s) Now continue on your own. (1.2s)
Start again at one… (1.2s)
And count to ten. (1.5s)
If you lose count, (0.5s) start over. (0.8s)
No judgment. (1.2s)
Just begin again. (18s)

Each time you start over is not a failure. (1.5s)
It's a moment of awareness. (2.5s)
A moment of returning. (7s)

Keep counting. (1.2s)
One to ten. (1.2s)
Over and over. (16s)

Notice the simplicity. (2.5s)
Just breath… (1.5s) and numbers. (2.5s)
Nothing else needed. (10s)

When you're ready to finish… (1.5s)
Let the counting go. (1.5s)
Just breathe naturally for a moment. (5s)

Then wiggle your fingers… (1.5s)
Roll your shoulders… (1.5s)
And open your eyes. (4s)

Simple. (1.5s) Clear. (4s)
