Before we begin, (0.15s) from the Serenity Prayer. (1.8s)

Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, (1.2s)
Courage to change the things I can, (1s)
And wisdom to know the difference. (6s)

Settle in… (0.8s) and close your eyes. (3.5s)

This meditation is about releasing control. (2s)
About surrender. (4s)

Think of something that's been weighing on you. (2.5s)
Something you've been trying to fix… (1.5s)
Or control… (1.5s)
Or figure out. (4s)

Just notice it. (2s)
Don't judge yourself for carrying it. (3s)
Just acknowledge it's there. (6s)

Now ask yourself… (1.5s)
"I can't actually control this." (3s)

If the honest answer is no… (1.5s)
It's time to practice letting go. (5s)

Imagine holding this worry in your hands. (2.5s)
Closed fists, (0.5s) gripping tight. (3s)
Feel the tension of holding on. (5s)

Now, (0.5s) very slowly, (0.8s)
Open your hands. (2s)
Palms up. (1.5s)
Releasing. (4s)

Say to yourself… (1.5s)
"I release what I cannot control." (5s)

Take a deep breath in. (4s)
And as you breathe out, (0.8s) feel it leaving. (5s)

Again. (0.8s)
"I release what I cannot control." (3s)
Breathe in. (4s)
Breathe out. (5s)

One more time. (1s)
"I release what I cannot control." (3s)
In. (4s)
Out… (1s) let it go. (6s)

Releasing doesn't mean you don't care. (2s)
It means you trust. (2s)
You trust the process. (2s)
You trust that not everything is yours to carry. (6s)

Feel your hands still open. (2s)
Palms up. (1.5s)
Receptive instead of grasping. (5s)

What if instead of controlling, (1s)
You simply allowed. (6s)

Rest in this openness. (12s)

There's peace in letting go. (3s)
There's freedom in surrender. (8s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Take one more deep breath… (4s)
Gently open your eyes, (1.5s)
Hands open, (1s) heart lighter. (2.5s)

Or (0.85s) keep your hands open, (1s)
Receiving rest instead of effort, (1.5s)
Surrendering to sleep. (5s)
