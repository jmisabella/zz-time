Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

There's a place inside you that's completely calm. (1.5s)
Even when everything outside is chaos, (1s)
That place remains untouched. (2s)
Let's find it. (6s)

Close your eyes gently… (1.5s) and settle in. (5s)

We're going to create a safe place in your mind… (2s)
A sanctuary you can visit anytime. (5s)

Take a deep breath… (4s)
And imagine you're standing somewhere peaceful. (3s)
Maybe it's a real place you know… (2s)
Or somewhere completely imagined. (5s)

Notice what you see. (3s)
Maybe a beach. (2s) A forest. (2s) A quiet room. (4s)
Just notice what appears. (6s)

Look around this place. (2s)
Notice the colors… (3s)
The light… (3s)
Any details that make it feel real. (6s)

Notice what you hear here. (3s)
Maybe waves… (2s) or wind in trees… (2s) or silence. (5s)

Notice what you feel. (2s)
The temperature of the air… (2s)
The ground beneath you… (3s)
Notice the textures. (6s)

Notice if there's a scent. (3s)
Ocean air… (2s) pine… (2s) flowers… (2s)
Or just clean, (0.5s) fresh air. (5s)

This is your place. (2s)
Completely safe. (2s)
Nothing can disturb you here. (6s)

Feel how calm it is. (3s)
Let that calm sink into your body. (5s)
Into your chest… (3s)
Your belly… (3s)
Your shoulders relaxing. (6s)

Breathe in the peace of this place. (8s)

Know that you can return here whenever you need to. (3s)
It's always here… (2s)
Waiting for you. (10s)

Rest in your safe place a little longer. (16s)

When you're ready to leave… (2s)
Take one more deep breath… (3s)
Knowing you can come back anytime… (2s)
And slowly open your eyes. (4s)
