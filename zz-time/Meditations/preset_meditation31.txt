Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

What if you spoke to yourself (0.8s)
The way you speak to someone you love. (1.2s)
With patience. (1s)
With kindness. (1s)
With forgiveness. (5s)

Close your eyes… (0.8s) and settle in. (4s)

This meditation is about changing the voice inside. (2.5s)
The one that criticizes. (1.2s)
The one that worries. (1.2s)
The one that says you're not enough. (5s)

Notice your breath for a moment. (3.5s)
Just breathing. (3s)
You're here. (1.5s)
That's enough. (5s)

Now think of something you've been harsh with yourself about. (3s)
Maybe a mistake. (1.2s)
Maybe a fear. (1.2s)
Maybe just existing in your anxiety. (5s)

Notice how that feels in your body. (2.5s)
Where do you hold that judgment. (3s)
Your chest. (1.5s)
Your throat. (1.5s)
Your stomach. (5s)

Now, (0.5s) imagine a friend came to you (1s)
With this exact same struggle. (2s)
What would you say to them. (4s)

You wouldn't say they're broken. (1.5s)
You wouldn't say they should be ashamed. (2s)
You'd say… (1.2s) "It's okay." (2s)
"You're doing your best." (2s)
"This is hard, (0.5s) and you're allowed to find it hard." (6s)

So say that to yourself now. (2s)
Out loud or silently. (1.5s)
"It's okay." (4s)

Breathe that in. (3.5s)
"I'm doing my best." (5s)

Again. (0.5s)
"This is hard, (0.8s) and I'm allowed to find it hard." (6s)

Feel how that softens something. (3s)
Maybe just a little. (2s)
That's enough. (5s)

Place your hand on your heart. (2s)
Feel it beating. (2s)
This heart that's carried you through everything. (4s)

Say to yourself… (1.5s)
"I'm here for you." (5s)
"You're safe." (5s)
"You're worthy of kindness." (7s)

Keep breathing. (2s)
Keep your hand there. (6s)

The anxious thoughts will come back. (1.5s)
The critic will speak again. (2s)
But now you have a different voice. (2s)
A kinder one. (1.5s)
And you can choose which one to listen to. (8s)

Rest here. (2s)
Hand on heart. (2s)
Breathing in compassion… (4s)
Breathing out judgment. (5s)

In… (4s) out… (5s)
In… (4s) out… (6s)

You are worthy of your own kindness. (3s)
Not someday. (1.5s)
Right now. (8s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Take one more deep breath… (4s)
And gently open your eyes. (4s)

Speak kindly to yourself today. (4s)
