Before we begin, (0.15s) consider this. (1s)

Everything rises and falls. (1.2s)
Breath. (1s)
Tide. (1s)
Emotion. (1.2s)
Nothing stays at its peak. (1.2s)
Nothing stays in its depths. (5s)

Close your eyes… (0.8s) and breathe. (3.5s)

Imagine you're at the ocean. (2.5s)
Sitting on the shore. (1.5s)
Watching waves roll in. (4s)

One wave comes… (2s)
Rises… (1.5s)
Peaks… (1.5s)
Crashes… (1.5s)
Then dissolves back into the sea. (4s)

Another wave comes. (1.5s)
The same pattern. (2s)
Rise… (1.5s) peak… (1.5s) crash… (1.5s) dissolve. (5s)

Emotions are like this. (2.5s)
They rise. (1.5s)
They peak. (1.5s)
They crash. (1.5s)
They dissolve. (4s)

Anxiety is a wave. (2s)
It feels like it will drown you, (1s)
But it always passes. (1.5s)
Always. (5s)

Think of a difficult feeling you've been having. (3s)
Maybe anxiety. (1.5s)
Maybe sadness. (1.5s)
Maybe anger. (3s)

Don't push it away. (2s)
Just watch it like a wave. (4s)

Feel where it is in your body. (2.5s)
Your chest. (1.5s)
Your throat. (1.5s)
Your stomach. (3s)

Notice… (1.5s) is it rising. (3s)
Is it at its peak. (3s)
Is it starting to fade. (4s)

Whatever phase it's in, (1s)
It's moving. (1.5s)
Waves don't stay. (1.5s)
They keep moving. (5s)

Breathe into the wave. (2s)
In… (4s) out… (5s)
In… (4s) out… (5s)

You're not the wave. (2s)
You're the ocean. (2s)
Vast. (1.5s)
Deep. (1.5s)
Unshakable beneath the surface. (6s)

The wave can't hurt the ocean. (2.5s)
It's made of the same water. (2s)
It belongs there. (5s)

Your emotions can't destroy you. (2s)
They're part of you. (1.5s)
They're allowed to be there. (5s)

Another wave comes. (2s)
Rise… (2s) peak… (2s) crash… (2s) dissolve. (4s)
Another one. (1.5s)
Rise… (2s) peak… (2s) crash… (2s) dissolve. (5s)

You just keep breathing. (2s)
You just keep watching. (6s)

The waves don't stop, (1s)
But you learn to let them move through you. (3s)
Without drowning. (1.5s)
Without fighting. (5s)

Rest as the ocean. (3s)
Deep. (1.5s)
Calm beneath. (1.5s)
Letting the surface move. (10s)

This too shall pass. (2s)
It always does. (7s)

When you're ready… (2s)
Take a deep breath in… (4s)
And let it go with a sigh. (5s)

Imagine the wave dissolving. (2s)
Returning to calm water. (3s)

Open your eyes. (4s)

The next wave will come. (2s)
And you'll ride that one too. (4s)
